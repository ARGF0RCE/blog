            "content": "Introduction . . Note: This post is for beginners who want to learn Machine Learning through python coding and for those who want a structured video lectures of the book, Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras and TensorFlow. For advanced users, I would suggest going through the curriculum in Notion for your own use case. . If you want a visual understanding then I would suggest following the short video on my youtube channel giving an overview of the series: . Hello World! I am Aditya Ramesh Ganti, a nerd-y (probably the word dosen’t exist, but nevermind!) student pursuing my B.Tech degree in Smart Manufacturing at PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur (wow, that’s a mouthful!😅 You can call it PDPM IIITDMJ). Jabalpur is a city in Madhya Pradesh, India. . I am a Machine Learning and Robotics Entusiast aiming to be one of the best in the field. I love doing research irrespective of the subject and gain knowledge, whether I remember it or not is secondary, though 😅. I have been learning Machine Learning and a little bit of Robotics for the past year and a half. And I thought I’d share my learning through the series of videos that I will be uploading weekly every Sunday starting today on my YouTube Channel. The series provides explanation of the concepts and do hands-on code provided in the book through Jupyter Notebook. All the code will be available in my github repo to get along with the videos. Though, the repo is still under development, all the code that were recorded will be provided before-hand. . Prequisites . A pinch of Python and a touch of some familiar Python’s scientific libraries - Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. . Also if you care about what is happening behind the scenes, you should have a reasonable understanding of college-level math as well. Khan Academy is a good place to brush up your math skills. . If you want a whole roadmap of what to learn to become a Machine Learning Engineer, I’d recommend the roadmap made by Mr. Daniel Bourke who is a self-learned Machine Learning engineer and is also one of my inspirations for creating content regarding the same. Thank you for all the hard work Mr. Bourke, looking forward to more videos of yours. . Why this course? . Actually I posted a discussion on his GitHub repo for the TensorFlow Deep Learning Course, regarding this series of videos… . . And that’s how it went. And I plan on following what he suggested. I am going to inspire you to do research on your own. There is Google to answer our prayers! . . So this course is going to cover as much as it can but also give you extra-curriculum activities which you need to google. Of course, it is not compulsory but it is always beneficial to be out of the comfort zone and take the initiative. 😎 . Hence, this course is going to be beneficial in not only gaining knowledge of Machine Learning, but also the methods of self-learning. . O’Reilly Hands-On ML Book Curriculum . Status .

I am Aditya Ramesh Ganti… So, you’re here to say all about me, My interests, hobbies, what I like, what I dislike..and all that, let’s begin then! . I was born in Bombay, India. I live in Hyderabad India with my mom, dad, and little sister. My mom has a lot of knowledge in coding like C C++ and other languages too, talk ‘bout multi-lingual.😅 My dad works in Cognizant and is good at table tennis and other sports.. and my little sister is currently in school studying 8th grade. . So, let’s start with my interests - I am interested in a lot of stuff let’s start with outdoor sports. I know a lot of sports, I can say I’m really good at them like Football, Table Tennis, Rugby (American Football), Badminton, Frisbee, Swimming, etc.. and I love coding the most, when I was in high school I started learning python. Slowly I started going deep in this coding journey, even my mom helped… My best language is currently Python.. and slowly I got a deep interest in robotics and then I knew the best possible robotic country is Japan, Tokyo… I started researching a lot about Japan and my love for it grew a lot, I even took a Japanese course and learned the language when I was in Btech… . And then came the word Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and, oh boy… I am glad that I jumped into this. The creativity and the potential ways we can go through ML in Robotics is just overwhelming (in a positive way…) . So now let’s go to my hobbies- I like to sing, draw, and do a little bit of dancing and I really like how to cook one day I’ll learn to cook really well, and I love anime, Spending time with my mom..and my dream is to become a professor in Japan, and of course, I love video games too. And I forgot to mention I am a Left Hander. and I love to ride a bicycle, it does not pollute and is eco-friendly. I am good at subjects like Mathematics and Physics. And I even read many books, mostly Chetan Bhagat, because I like the mystery in his stories. I am a fast runner too. My Favourite color is Sky Blue… I even adore cats so much, Even dogs. I Like viewing gaming computers, Various types of study tables On Youtube, I even designed my own table online. I even love Marvel, Starwars.., etc… . a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats. &#8617; . |",
