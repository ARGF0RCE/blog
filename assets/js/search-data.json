            "content": "Note: This post is for beginners who want to learn Machine Learning through python coding and for those who want a structured video lectures of the book, Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras and TensorFlow. For advanced users, I would suggest going through the curriculum in Notion for your own use case. . If you are visual person then I would suggest following the short video on my youtube channel giving an overview of the series: . youtube: https://youtu.be/S1F7gy-UK7I . Introduction . . Hello World! I am Aditya Ramesh Ganti, a nerd-y (probably the word dosen‚Äôt exist, but nevermind!) student pursuing my B.Tech degree in Smart Manufacturing at PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur (wow, that‚Äôs a mouthful!üòÖ You can call it PDPM IIITDMJ). Jabalpur is a city in Madhya Pradesh, India. . I am a Machine Learning and Robotics Entusiast aiming to be one of the best in the field. I love doing research irrespective of the subject and gain knowledge, whether I remember it or not is secondary, though üòÖ. I have been learning Machine Learning and a little bit of Robotics for the past year and a half. And I thought I‚Äôd share my learning through the series of videos that I will be uploading weekly every Sunday starting today on my YouTube Channel. The course provides explanation .",

I am Aditya Ramesh Ganti‚Ä¶ So, you‚Äôre here to say all about me, My interests, hobbies, what I like, what I dislike..and all that, let‚Äôs begin then! . I was born in Bombay, India. I live in Hyderabad India with my mom, dad, and little sister. My mom has a lot of knowledge in coding like C C++ and other languages too, talk ‚Äòbout multi-lingual.üòÖ My dad works in Cognizant and is good at table tennis and other sports.. and my little sister is currently in school studying 8th grade. . So, let‚Äôs start with my interests - I am interested in a lot of stuff let‚Äôs start with outdoor sports. I know a lot of sports, I can say I‚Äôm really good at them like Football, Table Tennis, Rugby (American Football), Badminton, Frisbee, Swimming, etc.. and I love coding the most, when I was in high school I started learning python. Slowly I started going deep in this coding journey, even my mom helped‚Ä¶ My best language is currently Python.. and slowly I got a deep interest in robotics and then I knew the best possible robotic country is Japan, Tokyo‚Ä¶ I started researching a lot about Japan and my love for it grew a lot, I even took a Japanese course and learned the language when I was in Btech‚Ä¶ . And then came the word Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and, oh boy‚Ä¶ I am glad that I jumped into this. The creativity and the potential ways we can go through ML in Robotics is just overwhelming (in a positive way‚Ä¶) . So now let‚Äôs go to my hobbies- I like to sing, draw, and do a little bit of dancing and I really like how to cook one day I‚Äôll learn to cook really well, and I love anime, Spending time with my mom..and my dream is to become a professor in Japan, and of course, I love video games too. And I forgot to mention I am a Left Hander. and I love to ride a bicycle, it does not pollute and is eco-friendly. I am good at subjects like Mathematics and Physics. And I even read many books, mostly Chetan Bhagat, because I like the mystery in his stories. I am a fast runner too. My Favourite color is Sky Blue‚Ä¶ I even adore cats so much, Even dogs. I Like viewing gaming computers, Various types of study tables On Youtube, I even designed my own table online. I even love Marvel, Starwars.., etc‚Ä¶ . a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats.¬†&#8617; . |",
