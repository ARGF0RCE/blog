## Introduction

Hello World! I am Aditya Ramesh Ganti... So, you're here to say all about me, My interests, hobbies, what I like, what I dislike..and all that, let's begin then!

I was born in Bombay, India. I live in Hyderabad India with my mom, dad, and little sister. My mom has a lot of knowledge in coding like `C` `C++` and other languages too, talk 'bout multi-lingual.ðŸ˜… My dad works in Cognizant and is good at table tennis and other sports.. and my little sister is currently in school studying 8th grade. 

So, let's start with my interests - I am interested in a lot of stuff let's start with outdoor sports. I know a lot of sports, I can say I'm really good at them like Football, Table Tennis, Rugby (American Football), Badminton, Frisbee, Swimming, etc.. and I love coding the most, when I was in high school I started learning python. Slowly I started going deep in this coding journey, even my mom helped... My best language is currently Python.. and slowly I got a deep interest in robotics and then I knew the best possible robotic country is Japan, Tokyo... I started researching a lot about Japan and my love for it grew a lot, I even took a Japanese course and learned the language when I was in Btech...

And then came the word Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and, oh boy... I am glad that I jumped into this. The creativity and the potential ways we can go through ML in Robotics is just overwhelming (in a positive way...)

So now let's go to my hobbies- I like to sing, draw, and do a little bit of dancing and I really like how to cook one day I'll learn to cook really well, and I love anime, Spending time with my mom..and my dream is to become a professor in Japan, and of course, I love video games too. And I forgot to mention I am a Left Hander. and I love to ride a bicycle, it does not pollute and is eco-friendly. I am good at subjects like Mathematics and Physics. And I even read many books, mostly Chetan Bhagat, because I like the mystery in his stories. I am a fast runner too. My Favourite color is Sky Blue... I  even adore cats so much, Even dogs. I Like viewing gaming computers, Various types of study tables On Youtube, I even designed my own table online. I even love Marvel, Starwars.., etc...
