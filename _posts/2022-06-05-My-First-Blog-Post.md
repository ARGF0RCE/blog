# Introduction
---

> **Note:** This post is for beginners who want to learn Machine Learning through python coding and for those who want a structured video lectures of the book, **[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)**. For advanced users, I would suggest going through the _[curriculum in Notion](https://rural-sapphire-cce.notion.site/O-Reilly-Hands-On-ML-Book-Curriculum-d6952ef1dd914ed19553a6235d0ee948)_ for your own use case.

> If you want a visual understanding then I would suggest following the [short video](https://youtu.be/S1F7gy-UK7I) on my youtube channel giving an overview of the series:

Hello World! I am Aditya Ramesh Ganti, a nerd-y (probably the word dosen't exist, but nevermind!) student pursuing my B.Tech degree in Smart Manufacturing at PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur (wow, that's a mouthful!ðŸ˜… You can call it [PDPM IIITDMJ](https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/)). Jabalpur is a city in Madhya Pradesh, India.

I am a Machine Learning and Robotics Entusiast aiming to be one of the best in the field. I love doing research irrespective of the subject and gain knowledge, whether I remember it or not is secondary, though ðŸ˜…. I have been learning Machine Learning and a little bit of Robotics for the past year and a half. And I thought I'd share my learning through the series of videos that I will be uploading weekly every Sunday starting today on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXF74-jFED_EYHGuL5HxvGQ). The series provides explanation of the concepts and do hands-on code provided in the book through Jupyter Notebook. All the code will be available in my [github repo](https://github.com/ARGF0RCE/Hands-On-ML-Made-Easy) to get along with the videos. Though, the repo is still under development, all the code that were recorded will be provided before-hand.

# Prequisites

A pinch of Python and a touch of some familiar Python's scientific libraries - [Numpy](https://numpy.org), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).

Also if you care about what is happening behind the scenes, you should have a reasonable understanding of college-level math as well. Khan Academy is a good place to brush up your math skills.

If you want a whole roadmap of what to learn to become a Machine Learning Engineer, I'd recommend the [roadmap](https://whimsical.com/machine-learning-roadmap-2020-CA7f3ykvXpnJ9Az32vYXva) made by [Mr. Daniel Bourke](https://www.mrdbourke.com/) who is a self-learned Machine Learning engineer and is also one of my inspirations for creating content regarding the same. Thank you for all the hard work Mr. Bourke, looking forward to more [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8O8l5cCX85Oem1d18EezQ/videos) of yours.

# Why this course?

Actually I posted a discussion on his GitHub repo for the [TensorFlow Deep Learning Course](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-tensorflow/), regarding this series of videos...

And that's how it went. And I plan on following what he suggested. I am going to inspire you to do research *on your own*. There is Google to answer our prayers!

So this course is going to cover as much as it can but also give you extra-curriculum activities which you need to google. Of course, it is not compulsory but it is always beneficial to be out of the comfort zone and take the initiative. ðŸ˜Ž

Hence, this course is going to be beneficial in not only gaining knowledge of Machine Learning, but also the methods of self-learning.
