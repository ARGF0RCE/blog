title: How I learned Machine Learning as a B.Tech Student majoring in Smart Manufacturing
---

# Introduction
---
Hello World! I am Aditya Ramesh Ganti, a nerd-y (probably the word dosen't exist, but nevermind!) student pursuing my B.Tech degree in Smart Manufacturing at PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur (wow, that's a mouthful!ðŸ˜… You can call it [PDPM IIITDMJ](https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/)). Jabalpur is a city in Madhya Pradesh, India.

I am a Machine Learning and Robotics Entusiast aiming to be one of the best in the field. I love doing research irrespective of the subject and gain knowledge, whether I remember it or not is secondary, though ðŸ˜…. I have been learning Machine Learning and a little bit of Robotics for the past year and a half. And I thought I'd share my journey on how and what I learned so far through this blog post.
