    "# Regular Expressions in Python for Data Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we're going to talk about pattern matching in strings using regular expressions. Regular expressions, or regexes, are written in a condensed formatting language. In general, you can think of a regular expression as a pattern which you give to a regex processor with some source data. The processor then parses that source data using that pattern, and chunks of text back to the data scientist or programmer for further manipulation. There's really three main reasons you woild want to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To check whether a pattern exists or not in some source data\n",
    "- To get all instances of a complex pattern from some source data\n",
    "- or to clean your source data using a pattern generally through string splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regexes are not trivial, but they are a foundational technique for data cleaning in dataa science applications, and a solid understanding of regexes will help you quickly and efficiently manipulate text data for further data science application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you could teach a whole course on regular expressions alone, especially if you wanted to demystify how the regex parsing engine works and efficient mechanisms for parsing text. In this lecture, we will learn a basic understanding of how regex works -enough knowledge that, with a little directed sleuthing, you'll be able to understand the regex patterns you see others use, and you can build up your practical knowledge of how to use regexes to improve your data cleaning techniques. By the end of this lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will understand the basics of regular expressions,\n",
    "- how to define patterns for matching\n",
    "- how to apply these patterns to strings,\n",
    "- and how to use the results of those patterns in data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally,\n",
    "> **Note:** In order to best learn regualr expressions, you need to write regexes.\n"
